    <h2>Northeastern University - Prof. Juner Zhu's group</h2>
    <p><em>Jun 2025 – Present</em></p>
    <p>
      At Northeastern, my research focuses on designing <strong>interpretable machine learning frameworks</strong> 
      for material characterization. I developed a physics-informed neural network (ICNN) with quadratic strain energy 
      constraints — ensuring energy positivity, symmetry, and positive definiteness. This framework achieved 
      <strong>98% R² accuracy</strong> on finite-element (FEM) strain–stress datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve interpretability, I integrated <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong> and symbolic regression (PySR), 
      extracting closed-form stress–strain relationships and stiffness constants 
      (C<sub>11</sub>, C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>22</sub>, C<sub>66</sub>) consistent with classical elasticity. 
      Current efforts extend toward <strong>plasticity modeling</strong>, leveraging RNN/LSTM architectures 
      to capture path-dependent material responses.

    <h3>Multi-Physics Modeling</h3>
    <p>
      Led large-scale CFD simulations on high-performance computing clusters to generate 
      training data for <strong>AI-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs)</strong>. This work reduced 
      simulation runtime from <strong>6 hours to just 20 seconds</strong>, enabling real-time 
      integration into system-level workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demonstrated a proof of concept on a solenoid valve, which secured 
      <strong>$80K in funding</strong> to mature the project. The approach leveraged 
      high-fidelity CFD models to train dynamic ROMs. Additionally, I applied workflows 
      to Airbus A320 Oxygen Systems, developing algorithms with <strong>NeuralODEs</strong> 
      and <strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong>, benchmarking them 
      against digital twin tools for ROM generation.
    </p>

    <h3>Surrogate Modeling & Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Developed surrogate models for Air Management Systems (MA700, Boeing 777X), 
      achieving <strong>95% R² accuracy</strong> and reducing model compilation time by 60%. 
      Applied advanced regression methods with automated hyperparameter tuning via 
      <strong>Bayesian optimization</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporated <strong>Uncertainty Quantification</strong> (KNN, MCMC) into ROM predictions, 
      integrating Python algorithms into MATLAB with an interactive GUI. The matured 
      solution is now <strong>deployed in production workflows</strong> at Collins, enabling 
      faster and more reliable plant model development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognized with <strong>2 trade secrets</strong> and <strong>two Star Awards</strong> 
      for delivering innovative solutions and advancing surrogate modeling capabilities.

    <h2>Reduced Order Modeling of a Heat Exchanger with a Stacking Ensemble</h2>
    <h3>IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE), 2022</h3>

    <p>
      Published and presented at <strong>IEEE ISSE 2022</strong>, this work proposed a 
      <strong>stacking ensemble framework</strong> for Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) 
      of a cross-flow heat exchanger to address computational inefficiencies in simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The model combined Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with a 
      <strong>Genetic Programming meta-regressor</strong>, achieving 
      <strong>R² &gt; 95%</strong> compared to ~85–90% for conventional ensemble models. 
      The ROM captured key input–output relationships 
      (inlet temperatures, pressures, and flow rates → outlet temperatures and pressures) 
      while reducing Simulink simulation runtime from minutes to seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
      A major advantage of this framework is its <strong>black-box deployability</strong>, 
      allowing industrial collaborators to use reduced models without exposing 
      proprietary system design details.
