    <h1>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Constitutive Modeling</h1>
    <h3>Northeastern University — Prof. Juner Zhu’s Group</h3>
    <p>
      At Northeastern, my current research focuses on the development of 
      <strong>interpretable constitutive models</strong> using physics-informed machine learning. 
      The primary goal is to create models that not only predict mechanical responses 
      but are also <strong>interpretable</strong> and provide physical insight. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ongoing efforts explore <strong>trainability on time-varying experimental data</strong>, 
      embedding physical constraints into architectures like PINNs and ICNNs, 
      and balancing predictive accuracy with <strong>interpretability of constitutive laws</strong>.

    <h1>Reduced Order Models & Surrogate Optimization</h1>
    <h3>Collins Aerospace — R&D Internship</h3>
    <p>
      At Collins Aerospace, my work spanned two key projects:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>
        <strong>Reduced Order Models (ROMs):</strong> Developed multi-fidelity ROMs 
        for aerospace components to reduce computational expense in CFD simulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Surrogate Modeling:</strong> Built machine learning-based surrogate 
        models for rapid design exploration and optimization, enabling efficient 
        trade-off analysis across operating conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These projects highlighted the synergy between <strong>physics-based simulation</strong> 
      and <strong>machine learning models</strong> for aerospace design acceleration.

    <h1>Reduced Order Modeling of a Heat Exchanger with a Stacking Ensemble</h1>
    <h3>IEEE ISSE Conference — IIT Guwahati</h3>
    <p>
      This publication presented a <strong>stacking ensemble method</strong> for reduced 
      order modeling of a heat exchanger, addressing computational inefficiencies 
      in system simulations. The approach combined multiple surrogate learners to 
      improve accuracy and generalizability over traditional ROMs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key contributions included:
    </p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Demonstrated ensemble surrogates outperforming single-model ROMs.</li>
      <li>Validated performance on experimental heat exchanger datasets.</li>
      <li>Showed significant reduction in computational cost with high accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
